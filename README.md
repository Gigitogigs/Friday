## 🔒 Security & Privacy

Friday is built with **privacy-first** principles:

### Permission Levels
| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | READ | Read-only operations (always allowed) |
| 1 | SUGGEST | Dry-run previews |
| 2 | SAFE_WRITE | Low-risk writes in user directories |
| 3 | SYSTEM_WRITE | System configuration changes |
| 4 | EXECUTE | Shell command execution |
| 5 | ADMIN | Elevated/dangerous operations |

### Safety Features
- ✅ **Approval Workflow** - Destructive actions require explicit user approval
- ✅ **Dry-Run Mode** - Preview actions before execution
- ✅ **Blacklist** - Permanently block dangerous commands
- ✅ **Audit Log** - Complete history of all actions
- ✅ **No External Calls** - All processing happens locally (network disabled by default)

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize Friday's behavior:

```yaml
friday:
  model: deepseek-r1:1.5b
  
permissions:
  default_level: SUGGEST
  auto_approve:
    - list_files
    - read_file
  blacklist:
    - format_disk
    - "rm -rf /"
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_permission_manager.py -v
```

**Current Status:** 12/12 tests passing ✅

## 📅 Development Roadmap

Friday is being built incrementally, one module per day:

| Day | Module | Status |
|-----|--------|--------|
| 1 | Permission & Safety Governor | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | OS Operator | 📋 Planned |
| 3 | Tool Orchestrator | 📋 Planned |
| 4 | Natural Language Interface | 📋 Planned |
